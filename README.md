### What I learned

 I learned the importance of structuring web content in a meaningful and accessible way. Semantic tags not only improve the readability of my code but also enhance its SEO (Search Engine Optimization) performance and make it easier for assistive technologies to interpret.

  Leveraging Flexbox for layout management was instrumental in creating a responsive and visually appealing Profile Card component. I learned how to use Flexbox properties such as display, flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to control the positioning and alignment of elements within a container. Flexbox allowed me to achieve a flexible and adaptive layout that adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.

  Integrating a background image into the Profile Card component provided an opportunity to enhance its visual appeal and personality. I learned how to use CSS properties like background-image, background-position, background-size, and background-repeat to customize the appearance of the background image and achieve the desired visual effect.
  
```css
body {
  background-image: url(images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-color: var(--Darkcyan);
  min-height: 100dvh;
}
```
